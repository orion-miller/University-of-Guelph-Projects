# About
This is a current group project. The course requirements for the project were broad; any electromechanical system which uses a relatively simple design and includes an in-depth modeling component. The group decided to build a custom damper dynamometer in cooperation with the Gryphon Racing FSAE team. My focuses included mechanical design, manufacturing, and damper modeling.
