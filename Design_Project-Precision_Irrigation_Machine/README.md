# About
This was a past group project. The course requirements were to try and create a useful new device within the fields of agriculture or food processing. The problem identified was the inefficiency of small hobby farms in comparison to mass produced monoculture crops, which are detrimental to soil health in the long term. The vision for this design was to create a small-scale proof of concept for an automated watering device that could accommodate different watering needs on a plant to plant level. By developing an irrigation machine, small scale hobby farms can be more efficient. My focuses included housing design, component selection, stress analysis, and manufacturing.
