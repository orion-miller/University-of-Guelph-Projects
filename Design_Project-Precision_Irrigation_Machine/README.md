# About
This was a past group project. The course requirements were to try and create a useful new device within the fields of agriculture or food processing. The problem identified was the inefficiency of small hobby farms in comparison to mass produced monoculture crops, which are detrimental to soil health in the long term. The vision for this design was to create a small-scale proof of concept for an automated watering device that could accommodate different watering needs on a plant to plant level. By developing an irrigation machine, small scale hobby farms can be more efficient. My focuses included housing design, component selection, stress analysis, and manufacturing.

## Technical Details
The device has two degrees of freedom to accomplish watering at given coordinates; one drive stepper for translational motion along a rack gear, and another stepper to
vary the angle of the watering spigot. The device rolls along an angle iron track to stay centered. The system was based from a Raspberry Pi running code in Python.
Preliminary Model of Device
View of Device Mounted on Test Bed Assembled Device
The test bed was filled with gravel and plants for demonstration purposes, with a water reservoir in the bottom so that water could be continuously repumped as needed,
During the design tradeshow, the device was successful and was able to accurately water rows by sliding along the rack.
