# University-of-Guelph-Projects
This repo contains files from various design projects I was part of during my time at the University of Guelph. To me these design courses were always the most exciting, because engineering is about the creativity and practical application of knowledge required to solve problems, and these projects allowed us to bring together everything we were learning and see what could be accomplished in a group environment.

## ENGG 41XX Senior Capstone Design - Carbon Fiber Rims


## ENGG 4220 Interdisciplinary Mechanical Design - Shock Dynomometer
Rebuilt and upgraded a shock dynomometer for testing damping characteristics of Formula SAE shock absorbers.

## ENGG 3280 Machine Design - Precision Irrigation System


## ENGG 3100 Design III - Microtube Heat Exchanger for SOFC Vehicle


## ENGG 4230 Energy Conversion - Solar Design


## ENGG 2100 Design II - Kinder Egg Toy
