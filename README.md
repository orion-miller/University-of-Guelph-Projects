# University of Guelph Projects
This repo contains files from various design projects I was part of during my time at the University of Guelph. To me these design courses were always the most exciting, because engineering is about creativity and the practical application of knowledge required to solve problems, and these projects allowed us to bring together everything we were learning and see what we could accomplish in a group environment.

## ENGG 41XX Senior Capstone Design - Carbon Fiber Rims
Designed and manufactured a prototype carbon fiber racing rim for application in a Formula SAE car.

## ENGG 4220 Interdisciplinary Mechanical Design - Shock Dynomometer
Rebuilt and upgraded a shock dynomometer for testing damping characteristics of Formula SAE shock absorbers.

## ENGG 3280 Machine Design - Precision Irrigation System
Created a precision irrigiation robot intended for automated watering of multiple plant types in small areas.

## ENGG 3100 Design III - Microtube Heat Exchanger for SOFC Vehicle
Designed a unique microtube heat exchanger for use with a Solid-Oxide-Fuel-Cell system in an automotive application.

## ENGG 3490 Mechatronics - Intelligent Bolt Sorter
Created a device to identify and mechanically sort various types of nuts and bolts.

## ENGG 4230 Energy Conversion - Solar Design
Designed a solar energy retro-fit system for a residential home.

## ENGG 2100 Design II - Kinder Egg Toy
Created a 3D-printed rocket style toy for a "Kinder Egg Toy" design project.
