# About
This is a year-long group design project currently underway. The project involves the development of lightweight carbon fiber racing wheels for FSAE. Producing carbon fiber parts is a highly specialized and time-intensive process, but when well executed they can provide superior strength and stiffness. The goal of this project is to produce a functional prototype and lay the groundwork for a transition to carbon wheels in the future. My responsibilities have included:
• Determination of suitable wheel loading cases
• FEA analysis of previous aluminum wheels
• Design of the wheel profile
• Design and manufacturing of molds
