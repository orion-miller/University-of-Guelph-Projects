# About
This was a past group project. The course requirements were to design a 3D printable kinder egg vehicle capable of travelling 2.5 meters. Special attention was given to designs with sharp aesthetics, speed, or large size. The goal of the group was to create a space shuttle style vehicle with the largest total size of the competition. My focus was the design and CAD of the device.
